Summary of Embedded Systems taught at the ETH (state of 2015), that includes (hopefully) all valuable information that is needed for learning and writing the open-book exam.


## Getting Started

The project relies on LaTex.


### Prerequisites

You need a LaTex distribution installed on your machine. For Ubuntu and similar distributions, texlive is available:

```
apt-get install texlive texlive-lang-german texlive-latex-extra
```


### Creating the PDF

Run the make file in the source folder:
```
cd src && make
```
It will generate the compiled file as `main.pdf`


## Artifacts

A compiled PFD is available in the `artifacts` folder.
